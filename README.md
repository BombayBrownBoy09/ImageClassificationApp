[Streamlit Application Link](https://bombaybrownboy09-imageclassificationapp-training-ah8ykd.streamlitapp.com/)

In this project, I hope to deploy a load tested Microservice ML Endpoint that uses Continuous Delivery - In particular, Google's Vision Transformer (ViT) model to take a hosted image url and return the class of that image (based on object detected in it). Enjoy the app by clicking on the link above!
